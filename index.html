                <h2>About Me...</h2>
                <p>I'm Italian but I've been living in London for a year.
                    I have always worked in the world of communication as a Social Media strategist. 
                    I am a dynamic person who always likes to learn and discover new things.</p>

                <h2>Why coding?</h2>
                <p> I began to understand that the world of coding by chance existed during a university internship.
                    <br>From that moment on I discovered a new world that immediately fascinated me. I started studying as an autodidact, but I think it's not enough to coding my work!</p>

                <h2>Why choose me?</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate worker and I am very well organized. I like challenges and new opportunities to learn.

                    In my last work experience, I started working as a Social Media Manager and I ended up working 50% of the time as a Front End developer with HTML and CSS because I was following an online course in my free time and I wanted to experience what I was learning .
                    <br>I want to create a change in my life and that's why I decided to follow the path of coding. It is not and will not be easy but I think it is a great opportunity that I want to take and carry on!</p>
